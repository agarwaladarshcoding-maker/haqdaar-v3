# PROJECT-UPDATE — what HAQDAAR can do right now

**How this file works.** Every time we chat or finish something, I add one entry at the top of
the log (§3) and fix §1 and §2 so they stay true. Plain words only.
Each entry says: what was added, what was changed, and what the project can do at that point.

---

## 1 · What the project can do today (13 Sep, D-day is 14 Sep)

**It can:**
- Take 12 real government schemes from myscheme.gov.in and save their pages (Step 7).
- Turn each page into a clean record: who it is for (age, gender, category, work, state),
  names people call it by, and a short summary — every fact backed by a quote from the page (Step 8).
- Answer telephony webhooks on `/answer` (TwiML Stream) and connect WebSocket on `/stream`,
  sending a 1-second 440 Hz μ-law tone, acknowledging DTMF digits and marks, and closing on digit 9 (Step 1).
- Run a **whole call in your terminal**: `make sim`. You press keys, it asks questions, narrows the
  schemes, reads out what matches, and writes a log of every turn (Step 6).
- Pick the next question that cuts the list down fastest (Step 4), drop schemes that don't fit (Step 3),
  and choose how to end the call (Step 5).
- `pytest -q` → **108 passed**.

**It cannot yet:**
- Run full voice dialogue over the phone call (waiting on speech model, TTS audio, and live dial verification).
- Speak Hindi or Marathi, or check a translation is safe. (Step 9 — today.)
- Play real voice audio. (Steps 10–12.)
- Understand speech — keypad only for now. (Steps 13–16.)

## 2 · Every file, and what it is for

### Rules and shapes — `haqdaar/contracts/`
| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `types.py` | The shape of everything passed between parts: answers, schemes, turn results. |
| `tunables.py` | Every number in one place (caps, timeouts, limits). No number lives in code. |
| `log_schema.py` | The shape of one log line. Seven kinds of line, including SILENCE. |

### The brain — `haqdaar/engine/`
| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `filter.py` | Removes schemes that don't fit the caller's answers. |
| `planner.py` | Picks the next question — the one that splits the list best. |
| `terminals.py` | Decides how a call ends: exact match, near match, or nothing found. |
| `call.py` | The call loop. Ties filter, planner and terminals together, turn by turn. |

### Data — `haqdaar/data/`
| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `log.py` | Writes the call log, one line per turn. |
| `corpus.py` | Loads the finished scheme snapshot and checks the files are not broken. |
| `pipeline/schemes.yaml` | The list of 12 schemes to fetch. |
| `pipeline/p1_scrape.py` | Fetches the 12 pages. Output: `data_cache/raw/`. |
| `pipeline/p2_derive.py` | Uses Groq to turn a page into a record + aliases + summary. Output: `data_cache/derived/`. |
| `pipeline/p6_snapshot.py` | Builds the final five snapshot files the phone call reads. |

### Sound and Telephony — `haqdaar/audio/`
| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pool.py` | Keeps audio clips ready: a small set always loaded, the rest loaded when needed. |
| `telephony/twilio.py` | Telephony wire codec (parse 6 inbound events, build 3 outbound events). |
| `telephony/__init__.py` | Isolates telephony wire codecs so vendor names never leak outside telephony. |

### Server and Tools
| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `haqdaar/server.py` | FastAPI app exposing `/health`, `/answer` (TwiML Stream XML), `/stream` (audio WS). |
| `tools/tone.py` | 8 kHz μ-law 440 Hz 1-second pure tone generator (no WAV/RIFF headers). |

### Other
| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `haqdaar/sim.py` | The terminal call. `make sim`. |
| `fixtures/` | 5 test schemes, 3 test callers, sample sounds — used by the tests. |
| `tests/` | 108 tests across filter, planner, terminals, call, scrape, derive, corpus, twilio_codec. |
| `Makefile` | Short commands: `make test`, `make sim`, `make run`, `make pipeline-scrape`, `make pipeline-extract`. |

### Not written yet
`p3_translate.py` · `p4_gates.py` (Step 9) · render (Step 10) · `model/` · `ear.py` `mouth.py` `turn.py`.

## 3 · Log — newest first

### 13 Sep · Step 1 implemented (Telephony smoke call)
**Added:**
- `haqdaar/server.py` — FastAPI server exposing `/health`, `/answer` (TwiML Stream XML with `keepCallAlive="false"`), and `/stream` (WebSocket).
- `haqdaar/audio/telephony/twilio.py` and `__init__.py` — Telephony wire protocol codec parsing 6 inbound events (`connected`, `start`, `media`, `dtmf`, `mark`, `stop`) and building 3 outbound events (`media`, `mark`, `clear`). Twilio isolation strictly maintained (no mention outside `haqdaar/audio/telephony/`).
- `tools/tone.py` — 8 kHz μ-law 440 Hz 1-second tone generator with zero RIFF/WAV headers.
- `tests/test_twilio_codec.py` — 10 tests proving all 6 inbound events, outbound builders, raw μ-law payload, and stream websocket behaviour.

**Changed:**
- `haqdaar/contracts/tunables.py` — Added telephony tunables (`TONE_FREQ_HZ=440`, `TONE_DURATION_S=1.0`, `TONE_AMPLITUDE=0.5`, `NGROK_DOMAIN`) and `.env` loading.

**Project can now:**
- Serve the telephony webhook, stream a 1-second 440 Hz μ-law tone on call start, receive DTMF digits and marks, and hang up when digit 9 is pressed. `pytest -q` → 108 passed.

### 13 Sep · day files for 13 Sep written
**Added:**
- `work-with-tools/2026-09-13.md` — two prompts to paste: Step 1 (phone call) and Step 9 (translate +
  gates). They run at the same time in two windows; they touch no shared file.
- `work-adarsh/2026-09-13.md` — your list: start the server, start ngrok, dial the number, fill the table.
- `PROJECT-UPDATE.md` — this file.

**Changed:** nothing in the code.

**Two things I fixed in the prompts, so they don't bite you:**
- The server file must be `haqdaar/server.py`, not `server.py` at the top. `make run` looks for
  `haqdaar.server:app`. The old prompt in `WORK.md` §4 said `server.py`.
- Step 9's gate 3 needs rendered audio, which only Step 10 makes. The prompt says: print `PENDING`
  for that half, don't fail on it. Otherwise no scheme could pass and Step 9 could never finish.

**Project can now:** same as yesterday — nothing new runs yet. After today it should answer a real
phone call with a beep and read keys, and have Hindi and Marathi text checked for unsafe words.

### 13 Sep · Step 8 finished and merged
**Changed:** `p2_derive.py` — the category quote can now come from the benefits text too; if a scheme
lists many kinds of workers, work is set to "any". Re-ran for all 12 schemes.
**Result:** category known for 12 of 12 (was 5). Twilio webhook checked live: `/answer`, POST.
**Project could:** turn 12 real pages into clean, quote-backed records.
